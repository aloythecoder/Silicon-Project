        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <div>
            <h3>Past</h3>
            <h4>Simon Riley had a very traumatic childhood while growing up in Manchester, England because of his
                heartless father. His father often brought dangerous animals back to their home and taunted him with
                them, even going so far as to force Simon to kiss a snake. When he and his younger brother Tommy grew
                older, Tommy would always wear a skull-mask at night to scare Simon. Simon's father would sometimes take
                him to the Bone Lickers concerts.</h4>

        <h3>Joining the Military</h3>
        <h4>Simon used to be an apprentice butcher at a grocery but joined the military after the September 11 attacks
            occurred. He eventually was accepted into the Special Air Service.</h4>

                <h3>Return from the Military</h3>
                <h4>Returning home on leave in January 2003, Simon found his mother and brother had hit rock bottom. His
                    brother, Tommy, was addicted to drugs and had been stealing from their mother to support his habit.
                    Simon chose to not return to the military until he had straightened things out for his family. He
                    worked to help Tommy overcome his drug addiction and, in March 2004, beat his father and threw him
                    out of the house for all the abuse he had inflicted on Riley and his mother. By June 2006, Tommy had
                    been clean for some time and married a woman named Beth. Riley served as the best man at Tommy's
                    wedding. Beth also gave birth to a young boy named Joseph who would become Riley's nephew.</h4>
